h1. Pongan : Server

This project is one of the three projects made for the Global Google Tv Hackathon London
The overall idea of the project is a modern version of Loren Carpenterâ€™s crowd experiment

The server is a GWT-Appengine application that permits the dialog between the controller and the display.

Parts of the project are :

- android controller for mobiles

- google tv display for the pong game

- google appengine to manage communication with channel api

Please remember that the code is done during an hackathon and as such shouldn't be use for any business scenario
